# Hexapod-Robot-Control-via-EEG-based-Mind-Signals-

This project aims to develop an innovative system for controlling a hexapod robot using brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, leveraging the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and the Robot Operating System (ROS). By utilizing EEG (electroencephalography) devices, the system captures and interprets the user's brain signals to command the hexapod robot.

1.⁠ ⁠Integration of an EEG headset with signal processing algorithms running on the Jetson Nano to decode mental commands.
2.⁠ ⁠Design and implementation of ROS-based software to map EEG signals to robot movements, utilizing ROS pub/sub for efficient communication.


The end goal is to enable hands-free operation of the hexapod robot, demonstrating the potential of mind-controlled robotics in applications ranging from assistive technologies to advanced human-robot interaction scenarios


Certainly! If you're looking to include a brief explanation of socket programming in your README file, here's a concise description you can use:

## Socket Programming Overview
Socket programming is a fundamental technology for network communication, enabling applications to connect, send, and receive data over a network. It uses the concept of sockets, which are endpoints for communication between machines or processes.

Key Concepts:
Socket: A socket represents one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. It includes an IP address and a port number.

Client-Server Model: Socket programming typically follows a client-server architecture:

Server: Waits for incoming connections from clients on a specified port. It handles multiple client connections simultaneously.
Client: Initiates a connection to a server's socket using the server's IP address and port number.
Communication Modes:

Stream Sockets: Provides a reliable, connection-oriented communication channel (e.g., TCP).
Datagram Sockets: Supports connectionless, unreliable communication where messages are sent in packets (e.g., UDP).
