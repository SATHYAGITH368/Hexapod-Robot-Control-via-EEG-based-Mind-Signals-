# Hexapod-Robot-Control-via-EEG-based-Mind-Signals-

This project aims to develop an innovative system for controlling a hexapod robot using brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, leveraging the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and the Robot Operating System (ROS). By utilizing EEG (electroencephalography) devices, the system captures and interprets the user's brain signals to command the hexapod robot.

1.⁠ ⁠Integration of an EEG headset with signal processing algorithms running on the Jetson Nano to decode mental commands.
2.⁠ ⁠Design and implementation of ROS-based software to map EEG signals to robot movements, utilizing ROS pub/sub for efficient communication.


The end goal is to enable hands-free operation of the hexapod robot, demonstrating the potential of mind-controlled robotics in applications ranging from assistive technologies to advanced human-robot interaction scenarios




## Socket Programming Overview
Socket programming is a fundamental technology for network communication, enabling applications to connect, send, and receive data over a network. It uses the concept of sockets, which are endpoints for communication between machines or processes.

Key Concepts:
Socket: A socket represents one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. It includes an IP address and a port number.

Client-Server Model: Socket programming typically follows a client-server architecture:


## Components
Server (read.py):

Acts as the brain interface, using EEG signals to determine the user's attention and meditation levels.
Utilizes socket programming to communicate with the client.
Sends commands to the robot controller based on the received EEG data.
Client (robot_controller.py):

Receives commands from the server via socket communication.
Controls the robot's movements on the Jetson Nano platform.
Commands include moving forward, rotating, and stopping the robot based on the EEG signals received.

## Requirements
Hardware:

Jetson Nano with appropriate peripherals for robot control.
EEG device compatible with the Jetson Nano.
Software:

Python 3.x
Libraries: socket, Jetson Nano APIs (specifics depending on robot control mechanisms).

## Setup and Usage
Server Setup:

Ensure the EEG device is connected and configured with the Jetson Nano.
Run read.py on the Jetson Nano.
Client Setup:

Adjust robot_controller.py to interface with your specific robot hardware.
Run robot_controller.py on the Jetson Nano.

## Operation:

The server (read.py) reads EEG signals and interprets attention and meditation levels.
Based on these levels, commands are sent via sockets to robot_controller.py.
The client (robot_controller.py) translates commands into robot movements (forward, rotate, stop).
Server: Waits for incoming connections from clients on a specified port. It handles multiple client connections simultaneously.
Client: Initiates a connection to a server's socket using the server's IP address and port number.
Communication Modes:

Stream Sockets: Provides a reliable, connection-oriented communication channel (e.g., TCP).
Datagram Sockets: Supports connectionless, unreliable communication where messages are sent in packets (e.g., UDP).
