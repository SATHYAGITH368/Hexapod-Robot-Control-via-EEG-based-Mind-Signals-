# Hexapod-Robot-Control-via-EEG-based-Mind-Signals-

This project aims to develop an innovative system for controlling a hexapod robot using brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, leveraging the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and the Robot Operating System (ROS). By utilizing EEG (electroencephalography) devices, the system captures and interprets the user's brain signals to command the hexapod robot.

1.⁠ ⁠Integration of an EEG headset with signal processing algorithms running on the Jetson Nano to decode mental commands.
2.⁠ ⁠Design and implementation of ROS-based software to map EEG signals to robot movements, utilizing ROS pub/sub for efficient communication.


The end goal is to enable hands-free operation of the hexapod robot, demonstrating the potential of mind-controlled robotics in applications ranging from assistive technologies to advanced human-robot interaction scenarios
